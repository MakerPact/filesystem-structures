# Filing System

This project provides a simple, yet powerful, filing system for your personal or professional documents. It's based on a hierarchical folder structure and a consistent naming convention.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can use the `create_folders.sh` script to create the recommended folder structure.

```bash
./create_folders.sh
```

## Documentation

For a detailed explanation of the filing system, including the folder structure, a flowchart for deciding where to file documents, and a universal file naming convention, please see the [documentation](./docs/index.html).
