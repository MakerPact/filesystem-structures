            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Overview</h2>
            <p>The Johnny Decimal System is a number-based filing system that provides a structured and scalable way to organize your files. It's perfect for managing large amounts of data and complex projects.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How it Works</h2>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4">
                <li>
                    <h3 class="font-bold">Step 1: Divide everything into ten things</h3>
                    <p>Take everything you need to organize and sort it into, at most, ten large buckets. Make sure the buckets are unambiguously different. Put a label on each bucket. This forces you to group things quite broadly, but that’s the point. We call these buckets your <strong>areas</strong>. An area might be ‘Finance’.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="font-bold">Step 2: In each area, divide in ten again</h3>
                    <p>Go through each bucket and repeat the process. This creates your <strong>categories</strong>. A category within the ‘Finance’ area might be ‘Tax Returns’. Now we have ten areas which contain ten categories each. That’s a hundred categories at the very most. It’s very unlikely you will end up with a hundred categories.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="font-bold">Step 3: Organize your files</h3>
                    <p>Finally, start to place files that you need to organize into these folders. Try to fit files into already existing categories. The more files you add, the more likely you are to encounter files that do not fit into your categories. Each time this happens consider if you have a lot of files without a home and create a new category to try to encompass as many of them as you can.</p>
