            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Overview</h2>
            <p>The PARA Method is a simple, flexible, and action-oriented system for organizing your digital files. It's based on the idea that you should organize your files based on their purpose and actionability, rather than just their topic.</p>

                    <p>Things you're actively working on with a defined goal and a deadline. Examples: "Complete the website redesign," "Plan a vacation," "Finish a course."</p>
                </li>

                    <p>Topics of ongoing interest that you want to keep track of, but that aren't tied to a specific project. Examples: "Gardening tips," "Interesting articles," "Design inspiration."</p>

                    <p>Inactive items from the other three categories. This is where you move completed projects, areas you're no longer involved in, and resources that are no longer relevant.</p>
